# INCREASING CONTRACEPTIVE PREVALENCE ACROSS THE WORLD

![Berg-Feature-image-Safer-world](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44275206/82988352-02a69000-9fc7-11ea-9ff6-ed0b2b3988ae.jpg)


### WHAT IS CONTRACEPTIVE PREVALANCE?
Contraceptive prevalence is the percentage of women who are currently using, or whose sexual partner is currently using, at least one method of contraception, regardless of the method used. It is usually reported for married or in-union women aged 15 to 49.
“(# of women 15-49 using a contraceptive method)*100" /“total # of women married or in-union aged 15-49)”

### IMPORTANCE
Contraceptive use slows population growth. This is important because overpopulation puts pressure on the environment, the economy and services such as education an d health.
Contraceptive prevalence is the most widely reported measure of outcome for family planning programs at the population level. Hence tracking it and more importantly understanding different factors that affect it is extremely important.

### WHY IS THE DEMONITATOR AS ALL WOMEN?
To obtain a true contraceptive use rate, the denominator should reflect the population at risk (of pregnancy), i.e., sexually active women who are not infecund, pregnant. The numerator should reflect the number of contraceptive users from that population. Secondly, an additional filter is that the women should be married and in union. Since quite a few countries are more conservative, the data reliability of this measure outside marriage for women would be low.

### OBJECTIVE
Primary: Whilst keeping the importance of Contraceptive prevalence in mind, the objective of this study was to explore the broad scope of factors that affect and do not affect the measure.
Specific Questions in Interest:
Q) GDP growth is an important parameter to access a country’s economic health. How does it affect Contraceptive prevalence .
R) Does changing the Government policies (on fertility) in a country affect CP.
S) Tourism tends to boost the economy of a country. Does it have any effect on CP.
T) Is Literacy rate of a country an important measure in increasing it’s CP.

### VARIABLE DEFINITIONS

ECONOMIC:
GDP annual: Gross domestic product (GDP) is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced within a country’s borders in one year. 
GDP per Capita: Annual GDP divided by its average population for the year. 
GDP Growth per capita: one quarter of the country’s gross domestic product to the previous quarter. 
PPP GNI: Purchasing Power Parity gross national income (GNI) converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GNI as a U.S. dollar has in the United States. 
GNI using Atlas Method: It is similar to PPP GNI. It instead uses a three-year average of exchange rates to smooth effects of transitory exchange rate fluctuations. 
HDI: The Human Development Index (HDI) is a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators HDI Rank: Countries ranked as per HDI Development Category: The UN has categorized nations to two categories, less developed and more developed countries.

FERTILITY POLICIES: 
Categories - Lower, Maintain, No Intervention, no official Policy and Raise.

GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION: 
Categories – Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin Amer. & Caribbean, Northern America, Oceania

POPULATION STATISTICS:
Population Density: The number of people living in per square km Total Population: Self-explanatory
Literacy Rate: percentage of the population aged 15 years and over who cannot both read and write Urbanization Rate: Average Annual Rate of Change of the Percentage Urban by Country
Gender Inequality Index: an index for measurement of gender disparity that was introduced in the 2010 Human Development Report 20th anniversary edition by the United Nations Development Program. Sex ratio: Population men/population female

TOURISM: 
Number of International Flight Arrivals: Self-explanatory


### CONCLUSION
GDP growth rate per capita is not an important variable! (The Standard error is high and the confidence interval includes 0). This initially was perplexing. GDP is high for countries which are developing while low for countries both developed and under developed.
Human Development index is the most important variable (t value=9.13). #Keeping all else constant, if the HDI increases by 0.1 units, the y variable increases by 10.35 units.
Number of international flight arrivals is fairly a significant variable too! This suggests that countries with higher tourism tend to have better contraceptive prevalence. #Keeping all else constant, if the arrival flights increases by 1 unit, the y variable increases by 4.8x10-8 units.
The other important variables are: sex ratio and urbanization rate. #Keeping all else constant, the Contraceptive prevalence decreases by -0.15 if sex ratio is increased by one unit while increases by 5.8 if urbanization rate increases by one unit.

### STUDYING THE EFFECTS OF FEW FACTORS INDIVIDUALLY
To see the effect of omitted factors, two things were done: 1) The individual effect of the variable 2) The difference between the actual and predicted values plotted against the omitted variables

Policies on Fertility: Individually, it has a clear trend. Lowering decreases CV while Raising increases it. But when plotted against the difference, the trend is flat, indicating that the policies do not add value over and above the variables in model. Region: The CV increases in order: Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America. For the 2nd analysis, it has the same effect like that of the Policies. Gender Inequality Index: As the disparity ↑,CV ↓. The second analysis, same conclusion.

Literacy Rate: Individually, it has a good trend. But when plotted against the difference, there trend is present, indicating that the Literacy Rate does add value over and above the variables in mode! GDP per Capita: Individually, it does have a decent trend. And when plotted against the difference, there is a trend present as well!
